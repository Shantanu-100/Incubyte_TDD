# Incubyte_TDD
1. I start by initializing the spacecraft's position to (0, 0, 0) and the direction to 'N' (north).
2. I then enter a loop that lets me input commands as long as I want to continue.
3. Inside the loop:
   - I'm prompted to enter a command (f, b, l, r, u, d).
   - I execute the command, which updates the spacecraft's position and direction accordingly.
   - I can see the current position and direction displayed.
4. After each command, I'm asked if I want to enter another command (y/n).
5. If I enter 'n' or 'N', I exit the loop.
6. Finally, I see the final position and direction of the spacecraft.
